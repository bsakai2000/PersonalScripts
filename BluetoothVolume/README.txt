Synchronizes volume between a Bluetooth device and a computer

btAudioMonitor listens for DBus events generated by mpris-proxy and changes
local volume to match, to ensure local volume always matches device volume.
This has been superseded by https://github.com/bsakai2000/BtAudioSync on my
system.

audio is called with either "up" or "down", and either 1) if device is not
connected, changes local volume by 5% in the specified direction, or 2) if
device is connected, changes device volume by calling its VolumeUp or
VolumeDown DBus methods through Bluez

When audio changes device volume, btAudioMonitor will synchronize changes back
to local volume, so both device and local volume keys will change device
volume, and local volume will always synchronize with device volume
