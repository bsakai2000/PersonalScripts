# PersonalScripts

A collection of scripts to make using my computer as easy as possible.

A number of these scripts already exist as basic Linux utilities, but I found
it both fun and informative to write my own versions, and to make sure
everything worked as smoothly for me as possible. Each utility has its own
folder and a short README.txt to explain what it does and how. Some of these
scripts may not work on any hardware but mine, including hardcoded Bluetooth
MAC addresses, so if you plan to use these be ready to tweak them to get the
functionality you need.
